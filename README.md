# First Neural Network From Scratch

The goal of this repository is to learn the theoretical basics about neural networks and to implement the knowledge into a small neural network.

In particular, we aim to learn the following things:

  -Backpropagation
  -Crossvalidation
  -Feed Forwarding
  -Gradient Descent Algorithm
  -Hyperparameter optimazion
  -Long-Short Term Memory

## About the structure of this repository

We want to use this repository to versionize our knowledge. This means that we start to implement from scratch and improve the code stepwise.

We start with the following:

  Step 1): Build a neural network from scratch with 3 input parameters, one hidden layer with X neurons and 1 output parameter
           With the informations (height, weight, shoesize) we want to classify a person into male or female
           The whole neural network will be written in the programming language C++ from scratch.
